## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access across devices. The deployed version can be accessed directly from any browser and installed as a PWA.

## Development & Running Locally

Due to browser security restrictions, this application should be served through a local web server rather than opened directly as files. This prevents CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when accessing local resources like the manifest.json file.

### Option 1: Using Python's built-in server

If you have Python installed:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
cd /path/to/LiftMate

# Start a simple HTTP server on port 8000
python -m http.server
```

Then open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

### Option 2: Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory  
cd /path/to/LiftMate

# Install serve if you don't have it
npm install -g serve

# OR use npx to run it without installing
npx serve
```

Then open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5000).
