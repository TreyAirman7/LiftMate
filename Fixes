Instructions for Features to FIX:
These are the features I wish to Fix. Do them one at a time. After confirmation that the changes are acceptable, you may remove the individual entry that you have completed. While applying these fixes, DO NOT CHANGE OR TOUCH ANY CODE THAT IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE FIX. BEFORE EVERY CHANGE MAKE A COPY OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DIRECTORY ON THE DESKTOP called "save". These copies should replace each other so we dont end up with a bunch of them.
